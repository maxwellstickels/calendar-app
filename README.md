## Overview

Any input that a user places in a textbox can be saved to local storage by clicking the Save button on the right of that textbox. This means the inputs to be saved across reloads, as long as the user remembers to save them.

The jumbotron at the top of the page displays the current date in the subheading. In addition, the textboxes are color-coded depending on the current time - the textbox representing the current hour is yellow is color, while previous hours are gray and future hours are light blue.
